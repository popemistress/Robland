# **App Name**: SolandWorldRecreation

## Core Features:

- Content Replication: Replicate the text, images, layout, and general structure of the existing SolandWorld website to a new Next.js application, following their design and content hierarchy.
- Interactive Map: Implement an interactive map feature (if present on the original site) allowing users to explore locations, click on points of interest, and view additional information.
- Article Display: Create a system to display articles or blog posts, ensuring the replicated style extends to the formatting and presentation of textual content. If present in original, allow the site admin to categorize them and also display tags. 
- Generative Image Expansion Tool: Use a generative AI model to offer users similar image suggestions when an image is missing or of low quality.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Earthy brown (#A67B5B) for a natural, grounded feel.
- Background color: Soft beige (#F5F5DC) to complement the earthy tones.
- Accent color: Muted olive green (#808000) for highlights and interactive elements.
- Body text: 'PT Sans', sans-serif, for clear and comfortable reading.
- Headline: 'Alegreya', serif, offering a touch of elegance.
- Use simple, outlined icons relevant to travel, exploration, and specific locations, if any, with an earthy color scheme.
